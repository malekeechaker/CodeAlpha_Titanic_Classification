# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project was completed during my internship with CodeAlpha. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is derived from the Kaggle Titanic competition.

## Project Structure

The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Importation:** Loading the Titanic dataset and displaying the first few rows.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing data distributions, visualizing relationships, and identifying missing values.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing data, dropping irrelevant features, and feature engineering.
4. **Modeling:** Implementing various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
5. **Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
