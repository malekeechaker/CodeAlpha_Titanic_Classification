# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project was completed during my internship with CodeAlpha. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is derived from the Kaggle Titanic competition.

## Project Structure

- `titanic_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis and machine learning model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required libraries and dependencies for the project.
